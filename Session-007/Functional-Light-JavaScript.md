# Chapter 1

### Why Functional Programming?
This first chapter's purpose is to answer questions like :
 - Why should I use FP style with my code?
 - How does Functional-Light JavaScript compare to what others say about FP?

#### At a Glance [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#at-a-glance)
quick remarks about this code comparison:

 - the former snippet feels closer to comfortable/readable/maintainable
 **BUT**
 that second snippet will eventually become a lot more natural, maybe even preferable! 
 - The goal is to illustrate the pros/cons of various patterns and enable you to make those decisions

#### Confidence [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#confidence)
 - code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand
 **OR**
  code that you don't understand is code you can't trust.
 - I don't mean to suggest tests are bad. But I do think we should aspire to be able to understand our code well enough that we know the test suite will pass before it runs. 
 - When we using FP, Someone who understands FP can read and verify that the program will do what they want
 - avoid the most common causes of program bugs!
  
#### Communication [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#communication)
 - code is as a means of communication with other human beings.
 - It's widely estimated that developers spend **70%** of code maintenance time on reading to understand it.
 - For example, once you learn what map(..) does, you'll be able to almost instantly spot and understand it when you see it in any program. But every time you see a for loop, you're going to have to read the whole loop to understand it.
 
 
#### Readability [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#readability)
  - Readability is not a binary characteristic. It's a largely subjective human factor describing our relationship to code.
  
#### Perspective [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#perspective)
   - this book will try to focus more on the base concepts and less on the fancy fluff.
#### How to Find Balance [Link](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch1.md/#how-to-find-balance)
 - "You aren't gonna need it" **(YAGNI)** is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
 - Remember, every single line of code you write has a reader cost associated with it.
