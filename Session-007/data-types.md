# Data types in JavaScript

### JavaScript is a `dynamically typed` language

7 data types in JS:
 - number `(all numbers include float, talk about Infinity and NaN and safe operation)`
 - string `(all strings are wrapped by '' - "" - ``)`
 - boolean `(true and false)`
 - null `(this is a special type, its not referred to null-pointer or other things. it's just empty!)`
 - undefined `(like null this type is just undefined! if a variable has not an assignment)`
 - object `(a special type to store collection of data)`
 - symbol `(its used to create unique identifiers for objects)`
